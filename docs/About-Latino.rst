About Latino
=============
What is Latino?
----------------
*Latino* is a fully functional programming language with Spanish syntax, starting in 2015.

This programming language is influenced by Python and Lua.

Latino can be used for:
  * Web development (server-side)
  * Database connectivity
  * Mathematics
  * System scripting

----

Why another programming language?
-----------------------------------
*Latino* was born from the need to increase education on computer science in Latin America; Therefore, students, as well as professionals, can get motivated to enter the world of programming and applications development with easy-to-learn syntax.

----

I code in English, why learning Latino?
--------------------------------------
There are not right answers to this question. If you enjoy experiencing new ways to program and like challenging yourself on a new adventure, then Latino will be a wonderful experience for you!

However, if you are a native Spanish speaker or speak a similar language such as Portuguese or Italian, this could be a great opportunity to learn an easy-to-learn programming language similar to your own language.

----

Advantages of this programming language
---------------------------------------
*Latino* is influenced by Python and Lua which provide great advantages when using.

#. **Easy Syntax**:
    * *Latino* have a very clean syntax which does not require a semicolon (;) at the end of each line of code, which is the case of several programming languages such as Java, JavaScript, C/C++, and others.
#. **High-level programming language**:
    * This means that this language looks gramatically similar to how we read and write. However, the `Low-level languages`_ are the ones that machinees understand, such as `Binary code`_ or `Assembly language`_.
#. **Portable**:
    * When we write code in *Latino*, it can be executed on whichever other platform in an easy and simple way. As opposed to other programming languages like the case of `Visual Basic`_ that only works on MS-Windows platforms.
#. **Open source**:
    * Any person can download the source code of *Latino*, modify it, extend the existing libraries, and contribute to its development if they wish.

Who develops Latino?
--------------------------
*Latino* is a language that has recieved the support of Hispanic users around the world and they have contributed to the growth of this project. Users have helped by popularizing and contributing to the source code of the language.

This language was created by Primitivo Roman in 2015 with the version v0.1-alpha until its version v1.0 was launched in 2017.

Currently, the language is in continued development under the direction of Melvin Guerrero on the versions v1.1.0, v1.2.0, v1.3.0 from now on.

----

What are the plans for the future?
------------------------------------
*Latino* continues its development to become an essential tool in the Latin America education and to be a good alternative in software development.

The development of this programming language looks forward to offering tools that allow the users to create object-oriented applications, mobile applications, videogames, and more!

Also as part of this language development, it looks for offering educational material of great quality, to thrive the motivation of using this language.

For example:
  * An accurate manual of great quality
  * Books for learning
  * Online course
  * Video tutorials
